This is my first project on my backend portfolio

Here I am using **Thunder client** for sending the requests.

**MongoDB** is the database which I am using here for storing the informaions.

This project doesn't contain any frontend as I want to experience how to create backend and how it works.


### Review
This was a good project to start with. Got to know about many things and how they work in real life.

Things that I learned and Takeaways :
1. DB connection
1. Creating and using Middlewares
1. Routes setup.
1. Segregating the files in seprate folders and setting up the controller.
1. Authentication

There are many more things That I have learned and started getting confidence in backend development.
