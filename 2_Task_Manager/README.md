# :heavy_check_mark: Task Manger
Made a mini project where I made a personal task manager and stored the task in the MongoDB database.

### Aim 
The main aim and learning from this project is to connect some static pages to complete the website and get data from the fornt end and operate on them.

<!-- Reference is form the 4 node js project form the freeCodeCamp video -->

*I have skipped the optimizaion part and tried to do olny the important stuff.* Many more things like using async handler and making a custom 404 page could be dont but skipped.
